Supply_Chain_Management_Project

Scenario: A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company has entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher management has notices that there is a miss match in the demand and supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which as a result as a loss in inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in entire country.


Goal & Objective: The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.
